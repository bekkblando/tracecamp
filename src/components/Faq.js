            <FAQ question="Where will the camp be held?">
              Because of covid, we have moved all of our
              opperations online. We have used this format
              for the last couple camps and have found it
              worked really well.
            </FAQ>
            <FAQ question="Can I suggest a course?">
              Sure! We would love to know what students want
              to learn. There are future camps in the works
              that we hope cover more topics.
            </FAQ>
            <FAQ question="Are the live streams from the bootcamps available?">
              We do not have any recordings available to the
              public at the moment. However, students
              accepted within the camp have access.
